        <h1>Cancellation & Refund Policy</h1>
        <p>Last updated: October 20, 2025</p>

        <h2>Overview</h2>
        <p>StayFinder Silk facilitates bookings for short-term stays. Cancellation and refund terms depend on the
            listing and host. The terms below apply when no host-specific policy is shown.</p>

        <h2>Standard Cancellation Rules</h2>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Full refund:</strong> Cancellations made at least 7 full days prior to check-in will receive a
                full refund (excluding any payment gateway fees).</li>
            <li><strong>Partial refund:</strong> Cancellations between 48 hours and 7 days prior to check-in will
                receive a 50% refund of the booking amount.</li>
            <li><strong>No refund:</strong> Cancellations made within 48 hours of scheduled check-in are non-refundable.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Exceptional Circumstances</h2>
        <p>For force majeure (natural disaster, government restrictions), refunds are considered case-by-case. Contact
            us at <a href="mailto:support@stayfinder.example">support@stayfinder.example</a>.</p>

        <h2>Host-specific Policies</h2>
        <p>If a listing displays host-specific cancellation policy, that policy overrides the standard terms.</p>

        <h2>How to Request a Refund</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Email <a href="mailto:support@stayfinder.example">support@stayfinder.example</a> with your booking ID
                and reason.</li>
            <li>We will acknowledge within 48 hours; additional docs may be requested.</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Payment Gateway Fees</h2>
        <p>Payment gateway transaction fees may not be refundable. We will notify you if fees are non-refundable.</p>
